# Eco-Guardians: Waste Warriors of Uganda

## Overview
*Eco-Guardians: Waste Warriors of Uganda* is a mobile game designed to teach children about the importance of waste management. Through interactive gameplay, children learn to sort waste into the correct bins and understand the value of recycling. This project combines fun and education to inspire the next generation to take care of the environment.

## Game Concept
The game involves two main activities:
1. *Waste Sorting*: Players drag and drop different types of waste into the appropriate bins, earning points for correct sorting. This helps children recognize recyclable and non-recyclable items.
2. *Quiz Section*: Players answer quiz questions related to waste management, reinforcing their knowledge and understanding of the importance of proper waste disposal.

## Features
- *Interactive Drag-and-Drop*: Children engage with the game by sorting items into designated bins, learning through a hands-on approach.
- *Engaging Visuals and Characters*: Child-friendly designs, vibrant colors, and playful characters make learning enjoyable and accessible for young audiences.
- *Progress and Feedback*: Players can track their progress with scores and levels, motivating them to continue learning.
- *Educational Quizzes*: Short quizzes test playersâ€™ knowledge and deepen their understanding of waste management concepts.

## Prototypes
The design process involved both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, created in Figma:
- *Low-Fidelity Prototypes*: Used to map out the basic structure, layout, and flow of the game, allowing for early-stage feedback and adjustments.
- *High-Fidelity Prototypes*: Developed to refine the visuals and interactions, ensuring the game is visually appealing and suitable for a young audience.
